## The Airdbar Desert

South of the Mobcap Wilderness and east of the Broken Kingdom, Is a large arid desert. It is hot dry and devoid of most all plant life, but there are beasts that roam the dunes, and snag unsuspecting travelers.

### Jahir

Once called the Gem of the desert, people used to travel the vast expanse of the desert to study at its legendary library. Now the city has erupted into civil war, with the city split into three sections each ruled by a different monarch. Since then the library has been under the control the southern faction of Zamir, which forbids outsiders in their section. The Safir and Ahmir (respectively, the west and east) sections are much more welcoming to outsiders.
