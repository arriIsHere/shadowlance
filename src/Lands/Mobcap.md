## Mobcap Wilderness

Located near a hundred miles east of the Swallowpeak mountain range, this vast forest marks the end of the Froust lands. Mobcap is a dark and dangerous forest with few know locations or well designed maps. It is rare for people to venture into the forest and even rarer for someone to return, those who tell tales of a dark forest filled with monsters, strange tribes, and other horrors.
