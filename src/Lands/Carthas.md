title: Elf Kingdom of Carthas

## Carthas

South of the Kingdom of Froust, is the elf land of AuugweÄ‘ (called Carthas by the human kingdoms). Their society is rather isolationist and they keep their borders tightly guarded. Though the elves stop short of actually harming potential trespassers, they have magical wards and spells protecting their border making it nearly impossible to gain access to the peninsula.

Even if a traveler manages to get past the border into Carthas, the elvish residences are magically hidden. So even if you can gain access to the land, the finding the cities will prove to be even more challenging.
