## Northern Ice Planes

If one continues on the trail of the Swallowpeaks, and then keeps moving north until after they end, they will find themselves in a cold and barren land, filled with snow, and ice. Travelers would do well to avoid this land as it’s unforgiving weather, lack of food, and short days have made it the final resting place of many an adventurer.

### The Spotted Islands

On its southern edge is the one hospitable (and oddly enough warm) place in all the ice planes. The spotted islands is the remote location where those who wish to learn "the way of the fire and Ice" go to devote themselves to the monastic life. The monks of the spotted islands may be far removed from society but they are well known for their hospitality, a warm meal and a good night’s rest are rarely refused to weary travelers.
