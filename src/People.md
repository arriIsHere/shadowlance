# The Races of Shadowlance

The land of Shadowlance has a great many peoples many different races and cultures. From the the diverse human cities and towns of the Broken Kingdom, to dragonborn city of Jahir any person, of any background imaginable can be found here.

## Humans

By far the most common, humans can be primarily found in the Broken kingdom of Froust, or as members of the various barbarian tribes of the Mobcap wilderness. Though, it is not unheard of to find humans living among the various factions of Jahir, or even among the Elves of Carthas. Humans are notable for their adaptability and variety, very few races have the diversity of culture that can be found in human lands. For this reason, human cities are commonly inhabited by other non-humans.

## Dwarves

Long ago the dwarfs were driven out of their homes in the mountains and hills. The hill dwarfs mostly migrated to the Kingdom of Froust, while the Mountain dwarfs mostly intermingled with the human barbarian Fethow tribe.


## Elves

In Shadowlance there are two common types of elves: the high elves of Carthas, and the wood elves who are split between the barbarians of the Mobcap wilderness, and the human cities of the broken kingdom of Froust.

Things were not always such though, the Carthas elves of the south and the Morning Elves of the east had their own kingdoms, while Carthas remained mostly intact after the fall of the human kingdom, the Wood elf kingdom perished, driven out by the advance of human villages into their wood grotto from the west. Now the Morning Elves live in lands that are not their own, and only recall remnants of their past culture in the shimmering forests.

## Halflings

Originally residing in the north-western lands, the halflings integrated into human society long before the fall of the kingdom. Their friendliness and attunement for socializing, made them fast friends of the humans. Halflings can be commonly seen throughout the Froustian kingdom, running boarding houses, pubs, or any sort of business that involves making a good impression on people.
