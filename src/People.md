# The Races of Shadowlance

The land of Shadowlance has a great many peoples many different races and cultures. From the the diverse human cities and towns of the Broken Kingdom, to dragonborn city of Jahir any person, of any background imaginable can be found here.

## Humans

By far the most common, humans can be primarily found in the Broken kingdom of Froust, or as members of the various barbarian tribes of the Mobcap wilderness. Though, it is not unheard of to find humans living among the various factions of Jahir, or even among the Elves of Carthas. Humans are notable for their adaptability and variety, very few races have the diversity of culture that can be found in human lands. For this reason, human cities are commonly inhabited by other non-humans.

## Dwarves

Long ago the dwarfs were driven out of their homes in the mountains and hills. The hill dwarfs mostly migrated to the Kingdom of Froust, while the Mountain dwarfs mostly intermingled with the human barbarian Fethow tribe.


## Elves

In Shadowlance there are two common types of elves: the high elves of Carthas, and the wood elves who are split between the barbarians of the Mobcap wilderness, and the human cities of the broken kingdom of Froust.

Things were not always such though, the Carthas elves of the south and the Morning Elves of the east had their own kingdoms, while Carthas remained mostly intact after the fall of the human kingdom, the Wood elf kingdom perished, driven out by the advance of human villages into their wood grotto from the west. Now the Morning Elves live in lands that are not their own, and only recall remnants of their past culture in the shimmering forests.

## Halflings

Originally residing in the north-western lands, the halflings integrated into human society long before the fall of the kingdom. Their friendliness and attunement for socializing, made them fast friends of the humans. Halflings can be commonly seen throughout the Froustian kingdom, running boarding houses, pubs, or any sort of business that involves making a good impression on people.

## Dragonborn

Of unknown origins, the dragon people hail from the city of Jahir (once known as The Gem of the Desert). In recent times Jahir has become fracturedâ€’divided into three factions, all of them vying for control of the city.

### Dragon Ancestry in Shadowlance
Dragonborn exist much the same way in Shadowlance as they do in the Greyhawk and Forgotten Realms settings. However, the people of Shadowlance have different names for dragon ancestr (in many cases because of differing appearances different appearances).

 ## Gnomes

Previously the companions of the mountain and hill dwarves, the gnomish peoples adjusted nicely their new home in the human lands. Being tinkerers and machinists the humans of Froust found them fascinating (not to mention useful) additions to their society, and so the Gnomes integrated easily. They managed to secure their own town in the frigid northern ice planes, where they tapped the heat of the earth for energy, and caried on their tinkering and research. 

## The half-humans

Many a time, human societies welcome races of similar cultures into their communities. While relationship starts out as as neighborly, it sometimes develops into something more, this union sometimes results in an offspring.

### Half Elves

Common, both within the kingdom of Froust as well as some barbarian tribes. Half elves exhibit the traits of both human adaptability as well as an elvish love of nature, and grace.

### Half Dwarves

Although they can be found in human society, half-dwarves are more commonly found in the Fethow barbarian tribe of the Mobcap Wilderness. These people have the sense of justice and strong bodies of their dwarf ancestory, along with the compassion and adaptability of humans. They are some of the most natured warm people in all the land and make the fastest friends.
