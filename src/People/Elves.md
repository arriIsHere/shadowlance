## Elves

In Shadowlance there are two common types of elves: the high elves of Carthas, and the wood elves who are split between the barbarians of the Mobcap wilderness, and the human cities of the broken kingdom of Froust.

Things were not always such though, the Carthas elves of the south and the Morning Elves of the east had their own kingdoms, while Carthas remained mostly intact after the fall of the human kingdom, the Wood elf kingdom perished, driven out by the advance of human villages into their wood grotto from the west. Now the Morning Elves live in lands that are not their own, and only recall remnants of their past culture in the shimmering forests.
