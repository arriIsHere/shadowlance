## Gnomes

Previously the companions of the mountain and hill dwarves, the gnomish peoples adjusted nicely their new home in the human lands. Being tinkerers and machinists the humans of Froust found them fascinating (not to mention useful) additions to their society, and so the Gnomes integrated easily. They managed to secure their own town in the frigid northern ice planes, where they tapped the heat of the earth for energy, and caried on their tinkering and research.
