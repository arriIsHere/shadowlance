## Halflings

Originally residing in the north-western lands, the halflings integrated into human society long before the fall of the kingdom. Their friendliness and attunement for socializing, made them fast friends of the humans. Halflings can be commonly seen throughout the Froustian kingdom, running boarding houses, pubs, or any sort of business that involves making a good impression on people.
