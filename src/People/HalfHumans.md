## The half-humans

Many a time, human societies welcome races of similar cultures into their communities. While relationship starts out as as neighborly, it sometimes develops into something more, this union sometimes results in an offspring.

### Half Elves

Common, both within the kingdom of Froust as well as some barbarian tribes. Half elves exhibit the traits of both human adaptability as well as an elvish love of nature, and grace.

### Half Dwarves

Although they can be found in human society, half-dwarves are more commonly found in the Fethow barbarian tribe of the Mobcap Wilderness. These people have the sense of justice and strong bodies of their dwarf ancestory, along with the compassion and adaptability of humans. They are some of the most natured warm people in all the land and make the fastest friends.
