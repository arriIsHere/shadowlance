## Humans

By far the most common, humans can be primarily found in the Broken kingdom of Froust, or as members of the various barbarian tribes of the Mobcap wilderness. Though, it is not unheard of to find humans living among the various factions of Jahir, or even among the Elves of Carthas. Humans are notable for their adaptability and variety, very few races have the diversity of culture that can be found in human lands. For this reason, human cities are commonly inhabited by other non-humans.
