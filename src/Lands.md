# The Lands Of Shadowlance

Across the continent, there are many geographic locales, each filled with its own unique culture and government along with its own unique mixture of people.

## The Broken Kingdom of Froust

By far the largest land in all of Shadowlance, the Kingdom of Froust is a land of fractured cities. Once united under the rule of the last Monarch of the Froustian throne, tryst, the land has since fallen into a loose confederation of cities, each with their own goals and wants.

### Lïdenborough

With walls of the strongest granite, LÏdenborough is the most safe place to be within all of the land of shadowlance. Given it’s intense security, many from the surrounding lands move here to make a life for themselves. Out of all the cities in the kingdom of Froust, this one is the most diverse.

### Glimmer

The city of glimmer rests on the southern coast of Shadowlance just between Carthas and the Southern Swallowpeak Mountains. Boasting both a rich population of magic users as well as a thriving academy for those seeking learning about the arcane arts, Glimmer makes a strong case for the most magically inclined city in the realm.

### Stalkvard

Created out of principle, Stalkvard is the home of many of the Gnomes of Shadowlance. There, they conduct research, craft items, and practice magic. All this is accomplished even while in the frigid wastes of the northern ice planes.

### Waterforde

Though not immediately notable, waterforde is an small cozy fishing town known for it’s hospitality. Many traveling up or down the coast find themselves staying the night there, due to its proximity to the great roads of the Froustian kingdom. It is also a favored source of fish, due to its proximity to LÏdenborough.

## Swallowpeak Mountains

Nearly bisecting the continent, the Swallowpleak range stretches from the northern ice planes, all the way south to the border of Carthas and the broken kingdom. The mountain range is divided into the northern and southern ranges by a small valley, the center of which holds the city of LÏdenborough. While the southern range is mostly barren except for a few mountain paths, the northern range holds a rich history and a culture that thrives, in spite of the cold and wind.

### The Spoji [SPO-JEE]

The Spoji are rather isolationist people and rarely venture outside the mountain range. Most are content with living out their lives in their tiny section of the world. Because of this isolation, few in Shadowlance know more about them beyond the general understanding that people might live up in the mountains. This is little more than speculation for most, and tales of their existence are little more than legend to them. There is just as much fact as fiction woven into the stories that the people of surrounding lands tell of the Spoji.

Rather than having a town or city, the Spoji have family homesteads, composed of their immediate and extended family. The homesteads (which are built into the sides of cliffs) are added onto as the family grows.

> ### Dwarven Ruins
> Long ago, the mountain dwarves built their great underground cities into the Swallowpeak mountains, but they were forced to leave for reasons that have been lost in the mists time. Now the old dwarven strongholds in the Swallowpeak Mountains remain barren, lying in wait for those with the courage and ambition to find their hidden treasures.

## Carthas

South of the Kingdom of Froust, is the elf land of Auugweđ (called Carthas by the human kingdoms). Their society is rather isolationist and they keep their borders tightly guarded. Though the elves stop short of actually harming potential trespassers, they have magical wards and spells protecting their border making it nearly impossible to gain access to the peninsula.

Even if a traveler manages to get past the border into Carthas, the elvish residences are magically hidden. So even if you can gain access to the land, the finding the cities will prove to be even more challenging.

## Mobcap Wilderness

Located near a hundred miles east of the Swallowpeak mountain range, this vast forest marks the end of the Froust lands. Mobcap is a dark and dangerous forest with few know locations or well designed maps. It is rare for people to venture into the forest and even rarer for someone to return, those who tell tales of a dark forest filled with monsters, strange tribes, and other horrors.

## Northern Ice Planes

If one continues on the trail of the Swallowpeaks, and then keeps moving north until after they end, they will find themselves in a cold and barren land, filled with snow, and ice. Travelers would do well to avoid this land as it’s unforgiving weather, lack of food, and short days have made it the final resting place of many an adventurer.

### The Spotted Islands

On its southern edge is the one hospitable (and oddly enough warm) place in all the ice planes. The spotted islands is the remote location where those who wish to learn "the way of the fire and Ice" go to devote themselves to the monastic life. The monks of the spotted islands may be far removed from society but they are well known for their hospitality, a warm meal and a good night’s rest are rarely refused to weary travelers.

## The Airdbar Desert

South of the Mobcap Wilderness and east of the Broken Kingdom, Is a large arid desert. It is hot dry and devoid of most all plant life, but there are beasts that roam the dunes, and snag unsuspecting travelers.

### Jahir

Once called the Gem of the desert, people used to travel the vast expanse of the desert to study at its legendary library. Now the city has erupted into civil war, with the city split into three sections each ruled by a different monarch. Since then the library has been under the control the southern faction of Zamir, which forbids outsiders in their section. The Safir and Ahmir (respectively, the west and east) sections are much more welcoming to outsiders.
